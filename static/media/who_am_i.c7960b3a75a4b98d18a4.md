# Who am I ?

Hey! Thanks for stopping by :smile:. My name is Wesley, and I am a 
Computer Science student at the Federal University of Campina Grande 
(UFCG) - Brazil. My major interests are in Fullstack development and 
Data Analysis.

I am planning to use this blog for taking notes of interesting 
technologies, to apply and study best practices and patterns, as well 
as improve my written english and development skills.

But you could ask: What are you going to do differently ? I thought 
about it as well. If I just wrote about theory on programming concepts,
it would be irrelevant - there are a lot of people that can explain them
better than I do. So, I aspire to just give short explanations, say where 
I would use them, and apply them in real code.
