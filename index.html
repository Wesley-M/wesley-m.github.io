        <p class="blocktext">Hi, my name is Wesley Matteus, and I'm a junior programmer who
        is fascinated about web development, thanks to its flexibility,
        support for amazing interfaces and fast feedback (running with
        a few steps from almost any device).<p/>
        <p>I'm also dazzled by the potential of creating beautiful animations
        with CSS and Javascript.  Besides that, I like to work in teams,
        because I believe that the best outcome can only be reached with
        cooperation in the first place.</p>

              <p class="details">In the university the lessons are much deeper in concepts and
                practice and I've had to review and profound pretty much everything
                that I already had some experience before. Moreover, I've had contact
                with various subjects that weren't exposed to me earlier, e.g. data
                structures with Java, problem solving with Python, graph theory and so forth.</p>

              <p class="details">The education was mainly focused on giving an overall vision
                about informatics, thanks to that vision the subjects were
                diverse: C++ (introduction to programming), web development
                (HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, SQL),  Java (POO) and a bit of
                computer networks and instrumental electricity.</p>
