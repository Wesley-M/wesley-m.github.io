        <p class="blocktext">Hi, my name is Wesley Matteus, and I'm a junior programmer who
        is fascinated about web development, thanks to its flexibility,
        support for amazing interfaces and fast feedback (running with
        a few steps from almost any device).<p/>
        <p>I'm also dazzled by the potential of creating beautiful animations
        with CSS and Javascript.  Besides that, I like to work in teams,
        because I believe that the best outcome can only be reached with
        cooperation in the first place.</p>
