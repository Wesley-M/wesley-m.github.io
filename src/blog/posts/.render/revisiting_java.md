# Revisiting Java
Hello :smile: ! Nice to see you again!

After thinking for a while on what I should write about, I came to 
the conclusion that we need to start with good foundations. And I have to 
confess that I am a little rusty in Java at the moment, so it would be very
convenient if we started there.

I am not going to show everything that you should know, and I am going to assume
that we both know about basic concepts in Java, like Classes, Objects, Interfaces, 
and so on. When applicable, I will add simple comments as reminders of definitions.
Other thing that I've to say is that I will be code-oriented, as we are just 
oiling our gears :car:.

But enough with the talking, let's get into it...
