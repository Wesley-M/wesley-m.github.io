Hey! Thanks for stopping by :smile:. My name is Wesley, and I am a
Fullstack Web Developer. I've recently graduated in Computer Science at the
Federal University of Campina Grande (UFCG) - Brazil. Previously I also have
taken a course on informatics in High-school (IFRN).

On my university days, I focused mainly in R&D on Distributed File Systems.
However, my passion is developing interactive web apps, like games and
useful/playful systems.

One of my favorite things to do is to learn new things and to apply them. As
well as seeing well-written, clean and efficient software work like expected
:rocket:

With that in mind, I am planning to use this blog to document my journey on
software development. Taking notes of interesting technologies, best practices
and design patterns, as well as improve my written english and dev skills.
