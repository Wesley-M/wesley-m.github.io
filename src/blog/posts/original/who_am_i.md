Hey! Thanks for stopping by :smile:. My name is Wesley, and I've 
recently graduated in Computer Science at the Federal University of 
Campina Grande (UFCG) - Brazil. My major interests are in Fullstack 
development and Data Analysis.

I am planning to use this blog for taking notes of interesting 
technologies, to apply and study best practices and patterns, as well 
as improve my written english and development skills.

But you could ask: What are you going to do differently ? I thought 
about it as well. If I just wrote about theory on programming concepts,
it would be irrelevant - there are a lot of people that can explain them
better than I could ever hope to do. So, I aspire to be more
practical-oriented.
